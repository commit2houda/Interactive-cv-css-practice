# An Online CV (CSS Practice)

This project was created during my early front-end learning phase as part of a web development bootcamp.
The idea was to put into practice everything I learned from HTML structure and CSS styling to basic animations, by building an interactive online CV.

## Note 
This project is archived as part of my early coding journey. 
It doesn't reflect my current focus on Big Data.
